# Water Jug Problem
A Lisp program for the water jug problem.

# Description
We have three water jugs A,B and C. A holds 7L of water, B 4L and C 2L. There is no other measuring equipment available and the jugs also do not have any kind of marking on them.  Now, assuming there is an infinite amount of water supply and we can empty the jugs, fill the jugs and transfer water from one jug to other. Solve the problem by initially emptying the containers by taking the appropriate actions to isolate 1 liter of water in the container b.

# Appropriate actions
- Fill a jug e.g. (fillA) to fill the jug A.
- Empty a jug e.g. (emptyA) to empty the jug A.
- Pour water from one jug to another e.g. (putAtoB) to pour water from jug A to jug B.
